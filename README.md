# UnlockMe
Unlock pattern quality tester: simulator of unlocking a mobile device using a point pattern (classic: Android 3x3), enabling configuration changes (e.g. 4x4, different appearance: turnover, change of the number of points in subsequent columns / rows, etc.)  Allow the user to set an unlock pattern. The application offers the possibility to configure the pattern by changing the dimensions of the board and the pattern itself. The software also saves the results of unlocking attempts and password changes to the remote repository (database) and at the same time checks the quality (strength) of the entered pattern.
